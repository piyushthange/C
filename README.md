# C
 This repo contains all the new programs I'll be creating in C with the
 help of book *The C Programming Language* written by **K&R**.
 I'll be scripting down my experience with the book as well as the 
 programs in it.

 The programs can be compiled using `gcc -o <output_exec_name> <file_name.c>`
 as well as using `make <file_name_only>`. `make` will produce an executable as 
 filename.
